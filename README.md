# Hang In There

This is a site that creates 2000s era motivational posters. The user can combine images, titles, and quotes either at random or of their own choosing. This is a simple site that uses vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Why did we make this?

Good question. We’re students at the Turing School of Software of Software and Design, and this is a site we built from a boilerplate for a class project. If you’re not one of our instructors we’re not sure why you’re looking at this but we hope you have fun!

## Wait who are you?

Alia Peterson, Cole Fiscus, and Boone Epstein. But note that we only wrote (most of) the main.js file! Instructors at the Turing School built the HTML, CSS, and poster.js files, and also provided us with arrays to use for the randomization, as well as a couple initial functions.


## Features

When you first visit Hang in There you’ll see a random poster with an image, title, and quote selected from our own arrays. If you click the Show Another Random Poster button, you’ll see exactly that: a new random poster. You can also click on any individual element of the poster (the title, image, or quote) to randomize just that element.

If you click the Make Your Own Poster button you’ll see a form that lets you - you guessed it - make your own poster. If you enter an image URL, title, and quote, you can view your custom poster by clicking the Show My Poster button. If any field is left blank, an alert message will indicate that all fields must be filled out before the poster can be created. The form only accepts images of the following file types: .jpeg, .jpg, .png, or .gif. An alert message will display when an image URL does not reference one of those file types.

If you like any of your posters you can save them with the Save This Poster button. You can click on the Show Saved Poster button to see everything you’ve saved. If you decide you don’t like one anymore, double click it to delete it. Note that each poster can only be saved once.


##Future Additions

Honestly we’re probably not going to add anything to this site after we turn in this project, but we have some ideas for features that might improve it.
